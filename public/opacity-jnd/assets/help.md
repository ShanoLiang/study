This study combines two parts: in the first part of this study, you will be shown images of an Ishihara color blindness test plate. You will be asked to identify the number or pattern in the image. This part is designed to ensure the accuracy of the study, as it aims to investigate the recognizability of the charts, which involve a lot of blended colors. In the second part of this study, you will be shown a series of two area charts, and you will be asked to select the chart that is more opaque (less transparent). This part contains 47-48 components. It will take approximately 10-15 minutes to finish this test. We suggest maximizing your browser window, as some charts can be on the larger side.
