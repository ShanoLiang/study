## Title of Research Study: Opacity Test
## Introduction
You are being asked to participate in a research study. Before you
              agree, however, you must be fully informed about the purpose of
              the study, the procedures to be followed, and any benefits, risks
              or discomfort that you may experience as a result of your
              participation. This form presents information about the study so
              that you may make a fully informed decision regarding your
              participation.

## Purpose of the Study
Visual representations of data (visualizations) are increasingly common in everyday life. The purpose of this study is to learn more about how the opacity level of charts can affect their recognizability.

## Tasks
This study combines two parts: in the first part of this study, you will be shown images of an Ishihara color blindness test plate. You will be asked to identify the number or pattern in the image. This part is designed to ensure the accuracy of the study, as it aims to investigate the recognizability of the charts, which involve a lot of blended colors. In the second part of this study, you will be shown a series of two area charts, and you will be asked to select the chart that is more opaque (less transparent). This part contains 47-48 components. It will take approximately 10-15 minutes to finish this test. We suggest maximizing your browser window, as some charts can be on the larger side.

## Risks to study participants
Each participant in this study is assigned a random ID for analyses. As such,
your participation will remain anonymous and your responses will
not be used to identify you.

## Benefits to research participants and others:
The possible benefits include exposure to interesting data
visualization, along with helping inform the
development of future experiment reporting techniques.

## Record keeping and confidentiality
Records of your participation in this study will be held
confidential so far as permitted by law. However, the study
investigators, the sponsor or its designee and, under certain
circumstances, the Worcester Polytechnic Institute Institutional
Review Board (WPI IRB) will be able to inspect and have access to
this data. Any publication or presentation of the data will not
identify you.

## Cost/Payment
Please check the Prolific description.
