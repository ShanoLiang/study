# PART II: Opacity Test

This is the second, as well as the main body, of this study. 

In this part, you will be shown a series of two area charts, and you will be asked to select the chart that is more opaque (less transparent). 

### Some judgement pairs may be difficult to distinguish -- for these, please try your best!

This part contains 47-48 components. It will take approximately 10-15 minutes to finish this part. 

We suggest maximizing your browser window, as some charts can be on the larger side.
