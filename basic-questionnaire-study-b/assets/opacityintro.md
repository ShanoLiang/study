# PART II: Opacity Test

This is the second, as well as the main body, of this study. In this part, you will be shown a series of two area charts, and you will be asked to select the chart that is more opaque (less transparent). This part contains 47 components. It will take approximately 10-15 minutes to finish this part. We suggest maximizing your browser window, as some charts can be on the larger side.
