This is the first part, the color blindness test, of this study. This part contains several images of an Ishihara plate, and you will be asked to identify the number or pattern in the image. This part is designed to ensure the accuracy of the following parts of this study, as the study aims to investigate the recognizability of the charts, which involve a lot of blended colors.
